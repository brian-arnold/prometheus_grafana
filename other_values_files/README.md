The ray_overrides.yaml file came from https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/install/prometheus/overrides.yaml, where they suggest how to deply the kube-prometheus-stack.

Can compare with vimdiff.

I didn't want to install it their way becuase the Ray docs use a very old version of the prometheus stack.
